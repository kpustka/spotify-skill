**Spotify has disabled my API access for the skill, it was violating their Terms of Service by enabling voice control. I must have missed this back in 2017 when I created the skill.**

To use this skill currently you will need to create your own "application using
https://developer.spotify.com". See instructions under the heading "Personal access token"
.
Listen to music from your Spotify Premium music account

## About
Stream your favorite music from the popular Spotify music service. Spotify
Premium users can search and play tracks from their own playlists or the huge
Spotify music library.

You can also control your Mycroft device using the Spotify Connect system.
So play DJ on your phone while listening on Mycroft!

### Authorization:
This Skill uses two different methods of authentication. Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.

#### API connection to your Spotify account
After installing `mycroft-spotify`, from the mycroft-core folder run the auth.py script in the mycroft-spotify folder

```
source venv-activate-sh
python skills/mycroft-spotify/auth.py
```

The script will try to guide you through connecting a developer account to the skill and store the credentials locally.

#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device
In addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:

`I couldn't find any Spotify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`

when you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.

If you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).

_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._
